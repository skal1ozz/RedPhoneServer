Custom RedPhoneServer

Here you can find samples of config files and descriptions
    "How to start TextSecure server"
    "How to start PushServer server"

This project is not relevant anymore, because Signal has dropped the RedPhone and they are using WebRTC at the moment.

I will keep this repo for now. If you still need this server for some reason,
please don't hesitate to contact with me
